Include Validation Checks: Ensure tests cover functionality, visual appearance, and user interactions.

4. Execute Test Cases
Manual Testing: Perform tests manually by interacting with the GUI to check for functionality and usability issues.
Automated Testing: Use automated testing tools to run repetitive or complex test cases.

5. Record Test Results
Document Findings: Capture the results of each test case, including any defects or issues encountered.
Log Defects: Report any bugs or inconsistencies found, providing details and screenshots if necessary.

6. Verify Defects
Re-Test: Once defects are fixed, re-test the affected GUI components to ensure the issues are resolved.
Regression Testing: Conduct regression tests to ensure that new changes haven’t adversely affected other parts of the GUI.

7. Review and Validate
Review Results: Analyze test results to assess overall GUI quality and compliance with design specifications.
User Feedback: Optionally, gather feedback from actual users to ensure the GUI meets their needs.

8. Document and Report
Prepare Test Reports: Summarize findings, including passed and failed test cases, and any defects reported.
