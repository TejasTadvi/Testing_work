Software Testing Assignment 

Module–1(Fundamental) 


 What is SDLC 

A Software Development Life Cycle is essentially a series of steps, or  
phases, that provide a model for the development and lifecycle  
management of an application or piece of software.

 What is software testing? 

Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its 
component(s)  with the intent to find that whether it satisfies 
the specified  requirements or not.

 What is agile methodology? 

Agile methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of a project. The agile methodology advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, encouraging flexible responses to change.

 What is SRS ?

SRS (Software Requirements Specification) is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It lays out functional and non-functional requirements, providing a complete description of the behavior of the system to be developed.

 What is oops 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.

 Write Basic Concepts of oops 

1)Object: An object is an instance of a class. It can hold both data and methods that can operate on the data.

2)Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data into one single unit.

3)Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting access to some of the object's components and protecting the object’s state from unauthorized access.

4)Inheritance: Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It helps to reduce redundancy by allowing existing classes to be reused.

5)Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.

 What is object 
  
An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates both data and functions that manipulate data. For example, if Car is a class, then myCar could be an object of the class Car.


 What is class 

A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.

Module–2(Manual Testing)


1)What is Exploratory Testing?

Exploratory testing is a software testing technique where test design, test execution, and learning occur simultaneously. It is an unscripted, adaptive approach that allows testers to investigate and learn about the software dynamically, often revealing defects that might be missed by more structured testing methods. The effectiveness of exploratory testing relies heavily on the tester's skills, experience, and intuition.
  
2) What is traceability matrix?

A traceability matrix is a document that links requirements to their corresponding test cases, ensuring that all requirements are tested and helping track the progress and coverage of the testing process. It helps verify that all requirements are met and can trace the impact of changes in the project.



3) What is Boundary value testing?

Boundary value testing is a software testing technique that focuses on testing the values at the boundaries of input domains. This method is based on the observation that errors often occur at the edges of input ranges rather than in the middle. By testing these boundary values, testers aim to uncover defects that might not be detected with other testing approaches.

Example of Boundary Value Testing
For an input field that accepts values from 1 to 10:

Valid Boundary Values: 1, 10
Invalid Boundary Values: 0, 11


4) What is Equivalence partitioning testing?

Equivalence partitioning (EP) testing is a software testing technique that divides input data into partitions or classes that are expected to be treated similarly by the software. The goal is to reduce the number of test cases while maintaining effective coverage by selecting representative values from each partition. This method assumes that if one test case in a partition passes, all other cases in the same partition are likely to pass as well, and vice versa.

Example of Equivalence Partitioning
Consider a function that accepts an integer input between 1 and 100:

Valid Equivalence Class: [1-100]
Invalid Equivalence Classes: [-∞ to 0] and [101 to ∞]


5) What is Integration testing?

Integration testing is a software testing process where individual units or components of a system are combined and tested as a group to identify any issues in their interactions and ensure they work together correctly.

6) What determines the level of risk?

A common tool used to evaluate risk levels is a risk assessment matrix, which plots the likelihood against the impact to categorize the level of risk as low, medium, or high.

7) What is Alpha testing?

Alpha testing is a type of software testing performed by internal staff and selected users within the organization before the software is released to external users. It is typically conducted in the development environment or a simulated environment that closely mimics the actual production environment.

Key Characteristics of Alpha Testing
1)Early Testing: 
2)Internal Testing: 
3)Controlled Environment: 
4)Focus Areas:
	Functionality: 
	Usability: 
	Reliability: 
5)Feedback Loop: 

8) What is beta testing?

Beta testing is a type of software testing carried out by a selected group of external users in a real-world environment just before the official release of the software. This phase allows developers to gather feedback on the product's usability, performance, reliability, and functionality from end-users who represent the software's target audience.

Example
A software company developing a new video editing application conducts beta testing by inviting a group of external users, including professional videographers and amateur filmmakers. These users install and use the beta version of the software to edit videos, provide feedback on features, report any bugs or crashes encountered, and suggest improvements to enhance usability and performance.

In summary, beta testing plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle by validating the software in real-world scenarios, gathering user feedback, and ensuring a smoother and more successful product launch.


9) What is component testing?

Component testing, also known as unit testing or module testing, is a software testing technique where individual components or modules of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the system. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed and meets its specification.

10) What isfunctional system testing?

Functional system testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the functionality of a system based on its specifications. It verifies that the system behaves according to its intended design and meets the functional requirements specified in the software requirements specification (SRS) or user stories.

11) What is Non-Functional Testing?

Non-functional testing is a type of software testing that verifies the non-functional aspects of a system, such as performance, usability, reliability, scalability, and security. Unlike functional testing, which focuses on specific functional requirements, non-functional testing evaluates how well the system operates under various conditions and stresses.

12) What is GUI Testing?

GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the graphical interface of an application. The purpose of GUI testing is to ensure that the graphical elements (such as windows, menus, buttons, icons) and user interactions (such as mouse clicks, keyboard inputs) function correctly according to the specified requirements.

GUI Testing Techniques
Manual Testing: Testers interact directly with the application's graphical interface, performing actions and validating responses manually.

Automated Testing: Uses GUI testing tools to automate test scripts that simulate user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons, entering text) and verify expected behaviors.

13) What is Adhoc testing?

Ad hoc testing is an informal and improvisational approach to software testing that does not follow any predefined test cases or test plans. Testers perform ad hoc testing based on their intuition, experience, and domain knowledge, focusing on exploring the software system without adhering to specific test scripts or procedures.


14) What is load testing?

Load testing is a type of performance testing that evaluates the behavior of a software application under specific expected load conditions. The goal of load testing is to measure the system's performance and stability when subjected to a typical or peak workload, such as a large number of simultaneous users accessing the application concurrently.

15) What is stress Testing?

Stress testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the stability and robustness of a system beyond its normal operational capacity, under extreme conditions or peak loads. The purpose of stress testing is to identify the breaking point or failure threshold of the system and understand how it behaves under intense stress.


16) What is white box testing and list the types of white box testing?

White box testing, also known as structural testing or glass box testing, is a software testing technique that examines the internal structure and workings of a system, focusing on the code and logic implemented within the software. Testers use knowledge of the internal structure of the software to design test cases that ensure all branches of code are executed and all logical paths are tested.

1)Unit Testing
2)Integration Testing
3)System Testing:
4)Component Testing:(unit Testing)
5)Path Testing:
6)Statement Testing (Coverage): 
7)Decision Testing (Coverage): 
8)Branch Testing (Coverage): 




17) What is black box testing? What are the different black box testing techniques?

Black box testing is a software testing technique that focuses on the functional requirements of a software application without considering the internal code structure, implementation details, or logic. Testers conduct black box testing based solely on the software's external specifications, user requirements, and expected behavior.

Different Black Box Testing Techniques

1)Equivalence Partitioning:
Divides the input data into partitions of valid and invalid classes.
Ensures that test cases cover representative values from each partition.
Reduces the number of test cases while maintaining test coverage.

2)Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):

Tests boundaries or limits of input values.
Identifies errors at boundaries more effectively than testing within the valid ranges.
Includes tests for minimum, just above minimum, just below maximum, and maximum values.

3)Decision Table Testing:

Tests combinations of inputs that result in different actions or decisions.
Represents complex business rules or logical conditions using decision tables.
Ensures all possible combinations of conditions are tested.

4)State Transition Testing:

Tests transitions between different states or modes of the application.
Uses state diagrams to identify valid and invalid state transitions.
Ensures that all state changes are tested, including transitions and actions triggered by state changes.

5)Pairwise Testing (Combinatorial Testing):

Tests interactions between pairs of input parameters.
Reduces the number of test cases compared to exhaustive testing while achieving high coverage.
Useful for testing systems with a large number of input parameters.

6)Error Guessing:

Uses testers' experience, intuition, and knowledge of common errors to identify potential defects.
Based on past defects or issues encountered in similar systems or functionalities.
Informal and subjective, relying on testers' expertise.

7)Exploratory Testing:

Tests the software dynamically and interactively.
Testers explore the application without predefined test cases, focusing on learning, investigation, and discovery.
Encourages creativity and finds defects that may not be identified through scripted tests.


18) Mention what are the categories of defects?

Defects in software development can be categorized into several types based on different criteria. Here are the common categories of defects:

1. Functional Defects: These defects arise when the software does not behave according to the specified functional requirements. Examples include incorrect calculations, missing features, or incorrect data processing.

2. Performance Defects: Performance defects impact the system's speed, responsiveness, or resource utilization. Examples include slow response times, high memory consumption, or inefficient database queries.

3. Compatibility Defects: Compatibility defects occur when the software fails to function correctly or display properly across different environments, such as various operating systems, browsers, or devices.

4. Usability Defects: Usability defects affect the user experience by making the software difficult to understand, navigate, or use efficiently. Examples include unclear user interfaces, confusing workflows, or inconsistent design elements.

5. Security Defects: Security defects expose vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the software or its data. Examples include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or improper access control.

6. Reliability Defects: Reliability defects impact the stability and availability of the software under normal operating conditions. Examples include crashes, freezes, or unexpected shutdowns.

7. Interface Defects: Interface defects occur when there are issues in the interactions between different software components, systems, or external interfaces. Examples include data format mismatches or communication protocol errors.

8. Documentation Defects: Documentation defects involve errors or inconsistencies in documentation artifacts such as user manuals, help guides, or system documentation. Examples include outdated information, unclear instructions, or missing documentation for new features.

9. Regression Defects: Regression defects occur when a previously working feature or functionality stops functioning as expected after changes or updates are made elsewhere in the software. These defects often result from unintended side effects or dependencies between different parts of the system.

10. Data Defects: Data defects involve issues related to the handling, processing, or storage of data within the software. Examples include data corruption, data loss, or incorrect data validation.

Each category of defect requires careful identification, classification, and resolution during the software development lifecycle to ensure the overall quality, reliability, and security of the software product. Comprehensive testing and quality assurance practices are essential to minimize and mitigate the impact of defects on the software's functionality and user satisfaction.

19) Mention what bigbang testing is?

Big Bang Testing is a software testing approach where all or most of the modules or components of a software system are integrated simultaneously and tested as a whole. This approach is typically used when individual modules or components of the system have been developed and tested independently, and now they are ready to be integrated to form the complete system.

20) What is the purpose of exit criteria?

Exit criteria in software testing define the conditions or criteria that must be met in order to complete a testing phase, release a software product, or proceed to the next phase of the software development lifecycle. These criteria serve several important purposes:

1. Quality Assurance: Exit criteria ensure that the software has been thoroughly tested and meets predefined quality standards before it is released or promoted to the next stage. They help in validating that the software is ready for deployment or further development.

2. Risk Management: Exit criteria help in managing project risks by providing clear guidelines on when testing activities can be concluded. They help teams assess and mitigate risks associated with software defects or issues that could impact deployment or user acceptance.

3. Decision Making: Exit criteria provide a basis for making informed decisions about the readiness of the software. Stakeholders can use these criteria to evaluate whether the software meets business requirements, technical specifications, and user expectations before making decisions on release or continuation.

4. Progress Tracking: Exit criteria serve as checkpoints during the testing process, allowing teams to track progress and ensure that testing objectives are being achieved. They provide transparency and accountability in testing activities.

5. Continuous Improvement: By defining exit criteria, teams can identify areas for improvement in testing processes, methodologies, and quality standards. They enable retrospective analysis and lessons learned to enhance future testing efforts.

21) When should "Regression Testing" be performed?

Regression testing should be performed whenever there are changes made to the software application. The primary purpose of regression testing is to ensure that recent code changes or modifications have not adversely affected the existing functionality of the software. Here are specific scenarios when regression testing should be conducted:

1. After Code Changes: Whenever new code is added, modified, or removed within the software application, regression testing should be performed to verify that these changes have not introduced new defects or caused unintended side effects.

2. After Bug Fixes: Once defects or bugs have been fixed, regression testing ensures that the corrections have been implemented successfully without impacting other parts of the software.

3. After System Upgrades: When there are updates or upgrades to the underlying system components, frameworks, libraries, or dependencies used by the software, regression testing ensures compatibility and functionality with the new environment.

4. After Configuration Changes: Changes in configuration settings, database schema updates, or environment variables can potentially impact the software's behavior. Regression testing helps verify that these changes do not disrupt existing functionality.

5. Periodically: Even in the absence of specific changes, regression testing should be performed periodically as part of ongoing maintenance to detect any unexpected regressions or deteriorations in software performance over time.

6. Before Release: Prior to releasing a new version or update of the software to production or to end-users, comprehensive regression testing is essential to confirm that all previously working features and functionalities continue to operate as expected.



22) What is 7 key principles? Explain in detail?

The "7 key principles" you're referring to are likely related to software testing and are often associated with the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) Foundation Level certification syllabus. These principles provide foundational concepts and guidelines for effective software testing practices. Here are the 7 key principles of software testing explained in detail:

1. Testing Shows Presence of Defects:
   - Principle: Testing can never prove the absence of defects, but it can show that defects are present in the software.
   - Explanation: Software testing is aimed at identifying defects or discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes. Test cases are designed to reveal defects, errors, or inconsistencies in the software under test. However, passing test cases do not guarantee defect-free software; they only indicate that no defects were found in those specific conditions.

2. Exhaustive Testing is Impossible**:
   - Principle: It is impossible to test all possible scenarios, inputs, and conditions within a software application.
   - Explanation: Software systems are complex, with a vast number of possible inputs, interactions, and paths. Complete testing of all possible combinations and scenarios would require an impractical amount of time and resources. Therefore, testing efforts should be focused on high-risk areas, critical functionalities, and typical user interactions based on risk analysis and prioritization.

3. Early Testing:
   - Principle: Testing activities should start as early as possible in the software development lifecycle.
   - Explanation: Early testing helps in identifying defects and issues when they are less costly to fix. Testing early can prevent defects from propagating into subsequent phases of development, reducing rework and overall project costs. It also facilitates early feedback, allowing for timely adjustments to requirements, design, and implementation.

4. Defect Clustering:
   -Principle: A small number of modules typically contain most of the defects discovered.
   - Explanation: Empirical studies have shown that defects tend to cluster in specific modules or components of a software system. By focusing testing efforts on these high-risk areas and critical modules, testers can prioritize their activities to maximize defect detection and minimize potential impacts on the software's functionality and quality.

5. Pesticide Paradox:
   - Principle: Repeating the same tests over and over again will eventually cease to find new defects.
   - Explanation: If the same set of tests is repeated without variation, it becomes less effective in finding new defects over time. To combat this, test cases should be regularly reviewed, updated, and supplemented with new tests to target different aspects of the software and expose previously undetected defects.

6. Testing is Context Dependent:

   - Principle: Testing approaches and techniques should be adapted based on the context of the project, including business objectives, technical environment, and stakeholder needs.
   - Explanation: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to testing. The effectiveness of testing strategies depends on the specific context of the software project, such as its complexity, criticality, regulatory requirements, and development methodology. Testing should be tailored to address specific risks and challenges unique to each project.

7. Absence-of-Errors Fallacy:
   
	Principle: Finding and fixing defects does not necessarily mean the software is ready for release.

   Explanation: Even if all identified defects are fixed, it does not guarantee that the software is free of all potential issues or meets all user expectations. Testing should focus not only on finding defects but also on validating that the software meets its functional and non-functional requirements, performs reliably under expected conditions, and satisfies user needs and expectations.

These 7 key principles provide a fundamental framework for understanding the goals, challenges, and best practices in software testing. They guide testers in planning, designing, executing, and evaluating testing activities to ensure the delivery of high-quality software products that meet business objectives and user requirements.

23) Difference between QA v/s QC v/s Tester

The terms QA (Quality Assurance), QC (Quality Control), and Tester are often used in the context of software development and testing, but they represent distinct roles and activities within the overall process of ensuring software quality. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

Quality Assurance (QA):

1. Definition: QA refers to the systematic process of ensuring that the software development process is designed, implemented, and executed in accordance with defined standards, procedures, and guidelines.

   - Collaborating with developers, analysts, and stakeholders to understand requirements and ensure test coverage.
   - Participating in test automation, performance testing, and regression testing activities.

4. Skills and Expertise: Testers require a combination of technical skills (knowledge of testing tools, test automation, etc.) and domain-specific knowledge (understanding of business requirements, user expectations) to effectively carry out testing activities.

 Key Differences:

- Focus: QA focuses on process improvement and prevention of defects, QC focuses on defect detection and correction, while testers execute testing activities and validate software functionality.
  
- Scope: QA and QC are broader in scope, encompassing overall process management and quality verification, whereas testing is more specific to validating software behavior and performance.

- Role and Responsibilities: QA and QC involve planning, designing, and implementing quality-related activities, while testers are primarily involved in executing tests, identifying defects, and ensuring software meets quality standards.

In summary, QA, QC, and testers play complementary roles in the software development lifecycle, each contributing to ensuring the delivery of high-quality software products. Effective collaboration and communication among QA, QC, and testing teams are essential for achieving software quality objectives and meeting user expectations.

24) Difference between Smoke and Sanity?

Smoke testing and sanity testing are both initial tests conducted on software builds to assess their basic functionality and suitability for further, more detailed testing. However, they serve slightly different purposes and are applied at different stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Here are the key differences between smoke testing and sanity testing:

 Smoke Testing:

1. Purpose:
   - Purpose: Smoke testing, also known as build verification testing (BVT), is performed to verify that the most critical functionalities of the software work correctly after a new build or release.
  
2. Scope:
   - Scope: It focuses on testing the basic functionalities of the software to ensure that the build is stable enough for further, more detailed testing.
  
3. Depth:
   - Depth: Smoke testing is typically shallow and does not involve exhaustive testing. It aims to quickly identify major failures or showstopper defects that would prevent further testing or deployment.

4. Timing:
   - Timing: Smoke testing is conducted early in the testing process, often immediately after receiving a new build or release candidate.

5. Automation:
   - Automation: It can be automated to rapidly verify essential functionalities and ensure quick feedback on build stability.

6. Examples:
   - Examples: Examples of smoke tests include verifying basic UI elements, login functionality, essential navigation, and critical workflows.

Sanity Testing:

1. Purpose:
   Purpose: Sanity testing, also known as sanity check, is performed to quickly evaluate whether specific new functionality or bug fixes introduced in a build are working correctly.

2. Scope:
   - Scope: It focuses on specific areas or functionalities that have been changed or added, rather than the entire application.

3. Depth:
   - Depth: Sanity testing is more focused and deeper than smoke testing. It verifies detailed functionality, integration points, or specific aspects affected by recent changes.

4. Timing:
   - Timing: Sanity testing is typically conducted after smoke testing, once the build passes the initial smoke test and is deemed stable enough for further, more detailed testing.

5. Automation:
   - Automation: While sanity tests can be automated, they often involve a combination of automated and manual tests to ensure thorough validation of new functionalities or fixes.

6. Examples:
   - Examples: Examples of sanity tests include testing new features, functionality enhancements, critical bug fixes, and ensuring that previously identified issues have been resolved.

 Key Differences Summary:

- Purpose: Smoke testing checks if the build is stable for further testing, while sanity testing checks specific functionalities or fixes.
  
- Scope: Smoke testing covers broad functionalities, while sanity testing focuses on specific changes or additions.
  
- Depth: Smoke testing is shallow and quick, whereas sanity testing is more detailed and comprehensive.
  
- Timing: Smoke testing is done early after receiving a build, while sanity testing follows smoke testing once the build is stabilized.

Both smoke testing and sanity testing are essential in ensuring that software builds meet basic quality criteria and are ready for more intensive testing phases. They help streamline the testing process by quickly identifying critical issues and verifying recent changes, thus contributing to overall software quality and reliability.

25) Difference between verification and Validation

Verification and validation are two fundamental processes in software testing and quality assurance, each serving distinct purposes in ensuring the quality and correctness of software products. Here’s a detailed explanation of the differences between verification and validation:

Verification:

1. Definition:
   - Verification is the process of evaluating software products to ensure that they meet specified requirements and fulfill their intended purpose.

2. Focus:
   - Verification focuses on assessing the software during development to determine whether it conforms to its specified requirements, design documents, and standards.

3. Activities:
   - Activities in verification include reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, and static analysis techniques to check documents, code, and other artifacts against specifications.

4. Questions Answered:
   - Verification answers the question, "Are we building the product right?" It confirms that the software is being developed according to the defined requirements and specifications.

5. Examples:
   - Examples of verification activities include code reviews, requirement analysis, design reviews, static testing (e.g., syntax checking), and compliance checks against coding standards.

 Validation:

1. Definition:
   - Validation is the process of evaluating a software product during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it meets specified requirements and satisfies its intended use case in its intended environment.

2. Focus:
   - Validation focuses on assessing the software product to ensure that it meets user needs, expectations, and performs its intended functions correctly.

3. Activities:
   - Activities in validation include dynamic testing (e.g., functional testing, usability testing, performance testing) to simulate real-world usage scenarios and verify the software against user requirements.

4. Questions Answered:
   - Validation answers the question, "Are we building the right product?" It confirms that the software meets user expectations, functions correctly in its intended environment, and solves the intended problem.

5. Examples:
   - Examples of validation activities include functional testing, acceptance testing, system testing, usability testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

 Key Differences Summary:

- Purpose: Verification ensures that the software is being developed correctly according to specifications, while validation ensures that the right product is being developed to meet user needs.
  
- Focus: Verification focuses on processes and documents, while validation focuses on the actual software product and its behavior.
  
- Activities: Verification involves static methods (reviews, inspections, etc.), while validation involves dynamic methods (testing, simulation, etc.).
  
- Timing: Verification occurs throughout the development lifecycle, while validation typically occurs towards the end of development or during testing phases.

 Relationship:

- Both verification and validation are essential components of quality assurance in software development, working together to ensure that software products are both correctly built and built correctly. Verification sets the foundation by confirming adherence to requirements, while validation ensures that the software meets user needs and performs as expected in its intended environment.

26) Explain types of Performance testing.

Performance testing is a crucial aspect of software testing aimed at assessing the speed, responsiveness, stability, and scalability of a software application under various conditions. It helps identify performance bottlenecks, assesses system behavior under load, and ensures that the application meets performance requirements. There are several types of performance testing, each focusing on different aspects of the application's performance characteristics. Here are the main types of performance testing:

1. Load Testing:
   - Purpose: Load testing is conducted to evaluate the application's behavior under normal and peak load conditions.
   - Objective: It verifies whether the application can handle the expected number of users and transactions within acceptable response times.
   - Method: Load testing involves simulating realistic user loads and monitoring the application's response times, throughput, and resource usage under load.

2. Stress Testing:
   - Purpose: Stress testing evaluates the application's behavior beyond normal load conditions to determine its breaking point or maximum capacity.
   - Objective: It identifies how the application behaves under extreme load, ensuring that it can handle unexpected spikes in user activity or resource demands.
   - Method: Stress testing involves gradually increasing the load on the system until it reaches its limits, observing how the application recovers or handles failures under stress.

3. Soak Testing (Endurance Testing):
   - Purpose: Soak testing checks the application's performance over an extended period under sustained load conditions.
   - Objective: It verifies system stability and assesses whether there are any memory leaks, performance degradation, or other issues that occur over time.
   - Method: Soak testing involves running the application under normal or heavy loads for an extended duration to detect any issues that may arise due to prolonged usage.

4. Scalability Testing:
   - Purpose: Scalability testing assesses how well the application scales in terms of handling increased user load and growing data volumes.
   - Objective: It evaluates the application's ability to maintain performance levels as user and data volumes increase or as resources are added.
   - Method: Scalability testing involves testing the application with increasing loads or resources to determine its capacity limits and scalability potential.

5. Volume Testing:
   - Purpose: Volume testing evaluates the application's performance when subjected to a large volume of data.
   - Objective: It checks how the application handles data storage, retrieval, and processing under varying data volumes.
   - Method: Volume testing involves testing with large datasets to assess database performance, data throughput, and system response times as data size increases.

6. Concurrency Testing:
   - Purpose: Concurrency testing examines how the application performs when multiple users or transactions access the same resources simultaneously.
   - Objective: It identifies issues such as deadlocks, race conditions, and resource contention that may occur under concurrent access.
   - Method: Concurrency testing involves simulating multiple users or transactions accessing the application concurrently and observing how the application manages concurrent access to resources.

7. Resilience Testing:
   - Purpose: Resilience testing evaluates the application's ability to recover and continue operating after a failure or disruptive event.
   - Objective: It assesses how well the application handles failures, such as server crashes, network failures, or database outages, without data loss or service interruptions.
   - Method: Resilience testing involves introducing failures or disruptions into the system and verifying that the application can recover gracefully and maintain functionality.

Choosing the Right Types:

- Project Requirements: Select performance testing types based on project requirements, user expectations, and performance goals.
  
- Testing Objectives: Align performance testing objectives with specific aspects of application performance, such as load handling capacity, scalability, or stability.
  
- Risk Analysis: Conduct risk analysis to prioritize types of performance testing that are most critical to the application's performance and user experience.

Each type of performance testing contributes to identifying different aspects of the application's performance characteristics, helping teams optimize performance, improve user satisfaction, and ensure reliability under various conditions.

27) What is Error, Defect, Bug and failure?

Error:
	Definition: An error, also known as a mistake or fault, is a human action that produces an incorrect result or behavior in a software application.
	
	Explanation: Errors can occur during any phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), such as requirements gathering, design, coding, or testing. They are typically caused by misunderstandings, miscommunication, or mistakes made by individuals involved in software development.

Defect:
	Definition: A defect, also known as a fault or issue, is an imperfection or flaw in the software application that may cause it to behave incorrectly, produce incorrect results, or behave unexpectedly under certain conditions.
		
	Explanation: Defects occur due to errors in coding, design, or implementation. They represent deviations from specified requirements, design documents, or expected behavior of the software. Defects can impact software functionality, performance, usability, or security.

Bug:
	Definition: A bug is a colloquial term used interchangeably with defect or issue, referring to a problem in the software that causes it to malfunction or behave unexpectedly.
	
	Explanation: Bugs are often identified during testing or after the software is deployed. They represent instances where the actual behavior of the software deviates from its intended behavior or user expectations. Bugs can range from minor issues affecting specific features to critical flaws that cause system crashes or data loss.

Failure:
	Definition: A failure occurs when the software does not perform its intended function or does not produce the expected output under specific conditions.

	Explanation: Failures are observable deviations from the expected behavior of the software during execution. They are typically caused by defects or bugs that were not identified and fixed before the software was released or deployed. Failures can impact user experience, system reliability, and business operations.

28) Difference between Priority and Severity 

In software testing and defect management, priority and severity are two important attributes used to categorize and prioritize issues identified during testing. Here's how they differ:

 Severity:

- Definition: Severity refers to the impact of a defect or issue on the functionality of the software and its impact on the user experience.
  
- Characteristic:
  - Critical: The defect causes a complete loss of functionality or the software crashes.
  - Major: The defect causes major functionality to fail, but the software does not crash.
  -Moderate: The defect causes minor functionality issues or inconvenience to users.
  - Minor: The defect is an aesthetic issue or a very minor inconvenience.

- Example: A defect that causes the software to crash whenever a certain button is clicked would be classified as critical severity.

 Priority:

- Definition: Priority refers to the order in which defects should be fixed or addressed, based on business needs, customer requirements, and project constraints.
  
- Characteristics:
  - High: The defect must be fixed as soon as possible because it affects critical functionality or is blocking further testing.
  - Medium: The defect should be addressed soon but does not impact critical functionality or can be worked around.
  - Low: The defect is minor and can be deferred to a later release or patch.

- Example: A defect that affects a core feature of the software and prevents users from completing critical tasks might be assigned a high priority, even if it has a moderate severity.



By understanding and applying severity and priority correctly, software development teams can prioritize their efforts effectively, improve software quality, and meet user expectations and business objectives more efficiently.

29) What is Bug Life Cycle?

The Bug Life Cycle, also known as the Defect Life Cycle, describes the stages through which a defect or bug typically progresses from identification to resolution in the software development process. It outlines the workflow and states that a bug goes through, involving various stakeholders such as testers, developers, and project managers. Here are the typical stages in the Bug Life Cycle:

1. New: 
   - Description: The bug is identified and reported by a tester or user.
   - Action: The bug undergoes initial triage and is entered into the bug tracking system with relevant details such as description, steps to reproduce, severity, and priority.

2. Assigned:
   - Description: The bug is assigned to a developer or development team for further investigation and resolution.
   - Action: The developer reviews the bug report, analyzes the issue, and begins working on fixing it.

3. In Progress:
   - Description: The developer is actively working on fixing the bug.
   - Action: The developer makes changes to the codebase or configuration to address the reported issue.

4. Fixed:
   - Description: The developer believes that the bug has been resolved in the code.
   - Action: The developer submits the fixed code for review and testing, often accompanied by notes or comments describing the fix.

5. Verified:
   - Description: The tester verifies that the bug has been fixed correctly.
   - Action: The tester retests the software using the steps provided in the bug report to confirm that the issue no longer occurs. If the bug is still reproducible, it is reopened and returned to the developer for further work.

6. Closed:
   - Description: The bug is confirmed to be fixed and meets the acceptance criteria.
   - Action: The bug is closed by the tester or project manager, indicating that the fix has been verified, and no further action is required.

7. Reopened:
   - Description: The bug is reopened if the reported issue resurfaces after being marked as fixed and closed.
   - Action: The bug returns to the Assigned or In Progress state, and the development process continues until the issue is resolved satisfactorily.

 Additional States (Depending on the Process):

- Deferred: The bug is acknowledged but not considered a priority for immediate fixing, often postponed to a future release or update.
  
- Duplicate: The reported issue is found to be a duplicate of an existing bug report, and efforts are consolidated into resolving the original bug.

- Cannot Reproduce: The reported issue cannot be reproduced following the steps provided, indicating potential environmental or user-specific factors.

 Importance of Bug Life Cycle:

- Process Management: The Bug Life Cycle provides a structured approach to managing defects, ensuring that each reported issue is tracked, addressed, and verified before being closed.
  
- Communication: It facilitates clear communication between testers, developers, and stakeholders by defining the responsibilities and actions at each stage of bug resolution.
  
- Quality Improvement: By systematically identifying, fixing, and verifying bugs, the Bug Life Cycle helps improve software quality, reliability, and user satisfaction over time.

Understanding and following the Bug Life Cycle helps software development teams maintain efficient defect management practices, streamline the debugging process, and deliver high-quality software products that meet user expectations and business requirements.

30) Explain the difference between Functional testing and NonFunctional testing

Functional testing and non-functional testing are two broad categories of software testing that focus on different aspects of a software application's quality and performance. Here's a detailed explanation of the differences between them:

 Functional Testing:

1. Purpose:
   - Purpose: Functional testing verifies that the software application behaves according to specified functional requirements and performs the functions it is intended to perform.
  
2. Focus:
   - Focus: It focuses on what the system does, its features, and how it responds to various inputs.
  
3. Testing Goals:
   - Testing Goals: Ensure that each function of the software operates in conformance with the requirement specification.
  
4. Examples:
   - Examples: Testing of individual modules, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

Non-Functional Testing:

1. Purpose:
   - Purpose: Non-functional testing verifies the characteristics of the software system such as performance, reliability, usability, scalability, and security.
  
2. Focus:
   - Focus: It focuses on how the system performs under specific conditions and constraints, rather than what the system does.
  
3. Testing Goals:
   - Testing Goals: Ensure that the software meets quality attributes such as responsiveness, speed, stability, and security.
  
4. Examples:
   - Examples: Performance testing, load testing, stress testing, usability testing, reliability testing, security testing, and compatibility testing.

Key Differences:

- Objective:
  - Functional Testing: Ensures that the software functions correctly according to its requirements and specifications.
  - Non-Functional Testing: Evaluates the performance, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes of the software.

- What is Tested:
  - Functional Testing: Tests the specific functions and features of the software application.
  - Non-Functional Testing: Tests the characteristics of the software application under different conditions.

- Focus:
  - Functional Testing: Focuses on validating the behavior of the system based on input and output.
  - Non-Functional Testing: Focuses on evaluating how well the system performs in terms of speed, responsiveness, stability, etc.

- Types of Tests:
  - Functional Testing: Includes tests like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
  - Non-Functional Testing: Includes tests like performance testing, load testing, usability testing, security testing, etc.

Importance:

- Comprehensive Testing: Both functional and non-functional testing are essential for ensuring overall software quality and meeting user expectations.
